# EPIB607 Final-Project

## Context

Your sister and her partner are expecting a child soon, and she just went to her obstetrician for her routine check. Because she in her second trimester, her obstetrician asks her to do a fetal cardiogram. The results will not get back to her until a week later. Your sister is a bit of a hypochondriac, so she is afraid that there is something wrong with her child.

So, her partner turns to you, a Masters student who is studying inferential statistics for health, hoping to find some results to calm your sister down.
Luckily, you have identified a publicly available dataset that includes thousands of fetal cardiogram results, and the classification of these babies’ health status. You need to convince your sister that she and her child will be safe.

Note: the objective of this exercise is to consolidate all the important concepts covered in EPIB607. When answer each question, be sure to include any units and assumptions and define all parameters, when appro- priate. The following questions are based on the publicly available dataset “Fetal Classification”, please find all attribute information of the data from the hyperlink.
